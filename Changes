Revision history for Perl extension List::Any/List::MoreUtils.

0.25_02 Sat Aug  1 06:41:55 EDT 2009
        - MS VC++ 7 doesn't like inline nor 'long long'
          (patch provided by Taro Nishino (taro DOT nishino AT gmail.com)
        - Newx isbn't around in older perls so use New(0,...) instead

0.25_01 Thu Jul 30 17:43:20 EDT 2009 
        - it seems the only way of handling the stack that works on all 
          flavors of the multicall API is by making a shallow copy of it
          and use that between the PUSH/POP_MULTICALL bracket
        - fix awkward ok() override in List-MoreUtils.t so that it reports
          line numbers in test failures properly

0.24  Sun Jul 19 08:26:35 EDT 2009
        - List::MoreUtils was not handling the stack properly when the stack was grown
          from inside code-references
        - a couple of tests for each_arrayref were calling each_array 

0.23  Sun Apr 19 06:56:09 EDT 2009
        - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
          fixed: Returning undef when none is passed an empty array is counterintuitive
          (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40905)
        - fixed: minmax error: unpredictable results with lists of 1 element 
          (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39847)
        - fixed: bug: uniq doesn't like undef values.
                 uniq warns on undef values
          (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=37533)
          (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43214)
        - fixed: bug in pairwise when $a and $b are lexically defined using my
          (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=44518)
        - fixed: Big memory leak with XS part()
          (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41097)
        - fixed: memory leak in indexes() [XS]
          (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41494)
        - reduced memory-requirements for the part() tests as that was responsible
          for a lot of unnecessary test-failures
        - new function bsearch() which performs a binary search

0.22  Sun Jul  2 11:25:39 EDT 2006
        - SvPV_nolen doesn't exist on pre 5.6 perls

0.21  Sun Jun 18 07:59:06 EDT 2006
        - propagate dies from inside the code-reference of pairwise to 
          caller

0.20  Tue Apr 25 15:43:57 EDT 2006
	- part() would destroy the list elements when changing
	  an array in place (@list = part { ... } @list)

0.19  Mon Mar 13 19:07:37 CET 2006
	- working down myself the queue of suggestions:
	  part() added

	- each_arrayref (XS) couldn't deal with refs to list literals

	   in comp.lang.perl.misc)

0.17  Wed Dec  7 10:45:43 CET 2005
	- each_arrayref had no XS implementation and wasn't
	  mentioned in the PODs
	  (patch by Anno Siegel <siegel AT zrz DOT tu-berlin DOT de>)

0.16  Mon Nov 14 09:57:28 CET 2005
	- a dangling semicolon in some macros prevented
	  the XS portion to compile on some compilers
	  (Lars Thegler <lars AT thegler DOT dk>)

0.15  Fri Nov 11 09:23:29 CET 2005
	- 0.13 and 0.14 broke the module on 5.6.x
	  (spotted by Thomas A. Lowery <tlowery AT cc3 DOT com>)
	- internals changed to make use of the new MULTICALL API 
	  which had to be backported to 5.005_x

0.14  Thu Nov 10 13:08:03 CET 2005
	- 0.13 fixed the leaks but rendered the XS part uncompilable
	  for perls < 5.6.0: Fixed
	  (spotted by Lars Thegler <lars AT thegler DOT dk>)

0.13  Wed Nov  9 16:29:02 CET 2005
	- nearly all functions receiving a CODE-block as first

	- 0.08 only fixed uniq() for scalar context

0.08  Fri Dec  3 17:11:14 CET 2004
	- uniq() was not mentioned in the perldocs and only had
	  the XS implementation
	- uniq() also produced wrong results on 5.8.0
	  (thanks to Slaven Rezic for spotting it and suggesting
	  a workaround)
	- the test-suite triggered a bug in 5.6.x perls
	- the test-suite now tests both the XS- and Perl-implementation
	- a wrong example in the perldocs fixed (Ron Savage)

0.07  Wed Dec  1 07:56:08 CET 2004
